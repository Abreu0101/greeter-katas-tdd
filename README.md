# Greeter - Katas TDD
Greeter Katas developed using TDD approach

All tests should always pass, regardless of environment conditions.

- Write a Greeter class with greet function that receives a name as input and outputs Hello <name>. The signature of greet should not change throughout the kata. You are allowed to construct Greeter object as you please.
- greet trims the input
- greet capitalizes the first letter of the name
- greet returns Good Morning <name> when the time is 06:00-12:00
- greet returns Good Afternoon <name> when the time is 12:00-18:00
- greet returns Good Evening <name> when the time is 18:00-22:00
- greet returns Good Night <name> when the time is 22:00-06:00
- greet logs into console each time it is called
